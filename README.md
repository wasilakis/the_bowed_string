# the_bowed_string

Within this project, matlab code has been developed that simulates the interaction between a bow and a string using an elasto-plastic friction model. It considers a finite-width bow and takes into account bow-hair compliance and string torsional motion. Special attention is given to numerical stability, by formulating a numerical scheme that guarantess passivity.
